# pakemon

This is a gamified frontend for hacking tools, meant to run with limited input (joystick) like on a pizero made to look like a gameboy.

It needs love & docker installed to develop locally.

```
# get files and deps
git clone --recursive https://github.com/notnullgames/pakemon-love-bettercap.git
cd pakemon-love-bettercap


# run test-net + bettercap server + frontend, in hot-reloading mode
make run

# get a list of more things you can do with make
make
```
